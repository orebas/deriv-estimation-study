# 4. Methodology

## 4.1 Test System

We selected the **Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model** as our test system, a well-established benchmark in dynamical systems with rich derivative structure across multiple orders.

**System equations:**
```
dx/dt = αx - βxy
dy/dt = δxy - γy
```

**Parameters:**
- α = 1.5 (prey growth rate)
- β = 1.0 (predation rate)
- γ = 3.0 (predator death rate)
- δ = 1.0 (predator growth from predation)

**Initial conditions:**
- x₀ = 1.0 (predator population)
- y₀ = 1.0 (prey population)

**Time span:** [0, 10] with 101 equally-spaced points (Δt ≈ 0.1)

**Observable:** We tested derivative estimation on the predator population x(t), which exhibits oscillatory behavior with varying amplitude.

**Ground truth generation:** High-precision numerical integration using the Vern9 algorithm (9th-order Verner method) with absolute tolerance 10⁻¹⁴ and relative tolerance 10⁻¹⁴, implemented in DifferentialEquations.jl. Ground truth derivatives (orders 0-7) were computed via automatic differentiation of the numerical solution.

**Rationale for system choice:** Lotka-Volterra provides:
- Non-trivial derivative structure (oscillations create varying magnitudes across orders)
- Known analytical properties for validation
- Realistic complexity comparable to real-world ODE systems
- Sufficient smoothness for high-order differentiation

**Limitations:** Results are specific to this single test system. Generalization to other ODE types (stiff, chaotic, discontinuous) requires additional testing (see Section 10).

## 4.2 Noise Model

**Type:** Additive white Gaussian noise

**Scaling:** For each noise level ε, we added noise scaled by the signal's standard deviation:
```
y_noisy(t) = y_true(t) + ε · std(y_true) · η(t)
```
where η(t) ~ N(0, 1) is standard normal noise.

**Rationale:** Constant-variance Gaussian noise is a standard model for experimental measurement error. Scaling by signal standard deviation ensures the noise level has consistent interpretation across different signals.

**Noise levels tested:** Seven levels spanning 8 orders of magnitude:
- 10⁻⁸ (near-noiseless, 0.000001%)
- 10⁻⁶ (0.0001%)
- 10⁻⁴ (0.01%)
- 10⁻³ (0.1%)
- 10⁻² (1%)
- 2×10⁻² (2%)
- 5×10⁻² (5%)

**Interpretation:** For the Lotka-Volterra predator population with std(x) ≈ 0.29, noise level 10⁻² corresponds to absolute noise std ≈ 0.0029.

**Randomization:** Three independent noise realizations per configuration, using Mersenne Twister PRNG with seeds 12345, 12346, 12347 for trials 1-3 respectively, ensuring reproducibility.

## 4.3 Experimental Design

**Configurations tested:**
- 8 derivative orders (0-7)
- 7 noise levels (10⁻⁸ to 5×10⁻²)
- 3 trials per configuration
- **Total:** 8 × 7 × 3 = 168 test cases per method

**Method coverage:**
- **Full coverage** (all 56 order×noise combinations): 16 methods
- **Partial coverage**: 11 methods
  - Central-FD, TVRegDiff-Julia: 14/56 configurations (orders 0-1 only)
  - Dierckx-5 and 8 others: 42/56 configurations (orders 0-5, missing 6-7)

**Endpoint treatment:** First and last evaluation points excluded from all error computations to avoid boundary effects, leaving 99 interior points for analysis.

**Failure handling:**
- Methods returning NaN or Inf for >80% of evaluation points marked as failed for that configuration
- Failed configurations excluded from that method's statistics
- Partial failures (some orders work, others fail) documented separately

**Data pipeline:**
1. Generate ground truth for Lotka-Volterra system once
2. For each configuration (noise level × trial):
   - Add noise to ground truth
   - Export to JSON for Python methods
   - Evaluate all Julia methods in-process
   - Call Python script with timeout (300s default)
   - Collect results (predictions, timing, success status)
3. Aggregate results across trials

## 4.4 Evaluation Metrics

### 4.4.1 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Definition:**
```
RMSE = sqrt(mean((y_pred - y_true)²))
```

Computed over interior points only (indices 2 to n-1).

**Limitation:** RMSE values are not comparable across derivative orders because derivative magnitudes vary by orders of magnitude.

### 4.4.2 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Definition:**
```
MAE = mean(|y_pred - y_true|)
```

**Advantage:** Robust to outliers

**Limitation:** Same cross-order comparison issue as RMSE

### 4.4.3 Normalized RMSE (nRMSE) — Primary Metric

**Definition:**
```
nRMSE = RMSE / std(y_true)
```

**Interpretation:** Error expressed as a fraction of typical signal variation
- nRMSE = 0.1 means error is 10% of signal's standard deviation
- Order-comparable: nRMSE = 0.2 has same meaning for 1st or 7th derivative

**Performance thresholds** (empirical guidelines):
- < 0.1: Excellent
- 0.1 - 0.3: Moderate
- 0.3 - 1.0: Acceptable for some applications
- > 1.0: Poor (error exceeds typical signal variation)

**Justification:** Absolute metrics (RMSE, MAE) favor low-order derivatives where magnitudes are naturally smaller. Normalized metrics enable fair comparison across orders, revealing which methods handle noise amplification effectively.

**Zero-crossing robustness:** Normalization uses global std(y_true) rather than pointwise values, avoiding division-by-zero issues when derivatives cross zero.

**Alternative considered:** Coefficient of variation (CV = RMSE / mean) was rejected because derivatives frequently have near-zero mean (oscillatory signals), making CV unstable.

## 4.5 Statistical Analysis

**Central tendency:** Mean nRMSE across 3 trials reported as primary statistic

**Uncertainty quantification:**
- Standard deviation across 3 trials
- 95% confidence intervals computed assuming normal distribution (t-distribution with df=2)

**Visualization:** All plots show mean with error bars (±1 std) or shaded regions (95% CI)

**Stability assessment:** Methods with high coefficient of variation (CV > 0.5) across trials flagged as unreliable

**Statistical limitations:**
- n=3 trials provides limited power for significance testing
- Wide confidence intervals with df=2
- **No formal hypothesis tests performed** due to insufficient sample size
- Qualitative interpretation: Non-overlapping CIs suggest strong evidence of difference

**Rationale for n=3:** Balances computational cost (27 methods × 168 configs = 4,536 evaluations) with basic repeatability verification. Future work should use n ≥ 10 for robust statistical testing (see Section 10.2).

## 4.6 Hyperparameter Optimization Protocol

**Objective:** Ensure fair comparison by providing equivalent optimization effort to all tunable methods.

**Gaussian Processes:**
- Hyperparameters: length scale (ℓ), signal variance (σ²_f), noise variance (σ²_n)
- Optimization: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) via L-BFGS-B
- Implementation: GaussianProcesses.jl (Julia), scikit-learn (Python)
- Bounds: ℓ ∈ [0.01, 10], σ² ∈ [0.01, 10] (prevent collapse)
- Initialization: Multiple random starts (3 per fit) to avoid local minima

**Splines:**
- Smoothing parameter (λ) selected via Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV)
- Implementation: Dierckx.jl (Julia), scipy.interpolate (Python)
- GCV minimizes predicted mean squared error on held-out data

**AAA Rational Approximation:**
- Tolerance: 10⁻¹³ (greedy termination criterion)
- Fixed for all evaluations (non-tunable)
- Precision: BigFloat (256-bit) for AAA-HighPrec, Float64 for AAA-LowPrec

**Fourier Spectral:**
- Filter fraction: 0.4 (retains lower 40% of frequency spectrum)
- Determined via preliminary grid search over [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95]
- Optimal value selected based on mean rank across orders 0-7 on validation data
- Fixed at 0.4 for all reported results

**Total Variation (TVRegDiff):**
- Regularization parameter (α) auto-tuned via internal algorithm
- Iteration limit: 100
- Convergence tolerance: 10⁻⁶

**Finite Differences:**
- No tunable parameters (stencil fixed by order and point count)

**Computational budget:** All methods allowed up to 300 seconds per evaluation (enforced via timeout)

## 4.7 Validity and Exclusion Protocol

**Rationale:** To ensure fair comparison and data integrity, we pre-registered exclusion criteria and performed systematic quality checks.

### 4.7.1 Exclusion Criteria

Methods were excluded from final analysis if they met any of the following conditions:

1. **Cross-language implementation failure:** When the same algorithm has implementations in both Julia and Python, and one implementation shows >50× worse mean nRMSE after parameter parity checks
2. **Numerical breakdown:** Mean nRMSE > 10⁶ across all configurations, indicating fundamental implementation failure
3. **Coverage failure:** Method fails (NaN/Inf) on >80% of test configurations

### 4.7.2 Methods Excluded

**GP-Julia-SE** (Gaussian Process with Squared Exponential kernel):
- Mean nRMSE: 38,238,701 (catastrophic failure)
- Likely cause: Hyperparameter optimization failure (length scale collapse) or kernel derivative implementation error
- Decision: Exclude from analysis; other GP variants (GP-Julia-AD, GP_RBF_Python) provide functional alternatives

**TVRegDiff_Python** (Total Variation Regularized Differentiation):
- Mean nRMSE: 14.186 (72× worse than Julia implementation: 0.195)
- Parameter parity check performed: Matched regularization parameters, boundary conditions, iteration limits
- Decision: Exclude Python implementation; retain Julia implementation (TVRegDiff-Julia)

**SavitzkyGolay_Python:**
- Mean nRMSE: 15,443 (17,500× worse than Julia implementation: 0.881)
- Likely cause: Parameter mismatch (window size, polynomial order) or numerical precision issue
- Decision: Exclude Python implementation; retain Julia implementation (Savitzky-Golay)

**Transparency note:** These exclusions reduce method count from 27 candidates to 24 analyzed methods. Exclusions are documented as findings about implementation quality (see Section 7.6).

### 4.7.3 Parameter Parity Protocol

For cross-language implementations, we verified parameter equivalence:
- Window sizes, polynomial degrees, and stencil widths matched exactly
- Regularization parameters (λ, α) synchronized
- Boundary handling modes (natural, periodic, mirror) standardized
- Noise prior variances aligned for probabilistic methods

### 4.7.4 Coverage Accounting

**Full coverage** (56/56 configurations): 16 methods tested across all 8 orders × 7 noise levels

**Partial coverage:** 11 methods missing some configurations
- Central-FD: 25% coverage (14/56 configs, orders 0-1 only)
- TVRegDiff-Julia: 25% coverage (14/56 configs, orders 0-1 only)
- Dierckx-5 and 8 others: 75% coverage (42/56 configs, orders 0-5, missing 6-7)

**Ranking policy:**
- Overall rankings computed only over configurations where methods were tested
- Coverage percentages reported in all ranking tables (see Table 2)
- **Naive rankings misleading:** Methods tested only on "easy" configs (low orders, low noise) appear artificially superior
- **Coverage-normalized rankings:** Primary rankings restricted to 16 full-coverage methods for fair comparison

### 4.7.5 Runtime Measurement Standardization

**Hardware:** All benchmarks run on identical hardware (see Section 9.2)

**Precision consistency:**
- Timing measured at same numerical precision as accuracy runs
- AAA-HighPrec: BigFloat precision for both accuracy and timing
- All others: Float64 precision

**Warm-up:** 1 warm-up run per method to exclude JIT compilation overhead (Julia methods only)

**Timing procedure:**
1. Exclude data loading and preprocessing (not part of method cost)
2. Time only the differentiation computation (fitting + evaluation)
3. Report median across 3 trials to reduce variance from system load

**Timeout:** Methods exceeding 300 seconds marked as failed for that configuration

### 4.7.6 Endpoint and Boundary Handling

**Evaluation grid:** All methods evaluated on identical interior points (indices 2 to n-1), giving 99-point comparison grid

**Boundary treatment:**
- **Fourier methods:** Symmetric extension to enforce periodicity
- **Splines:** Natural boundary conditions (zero second derivative at endpoints)
- **Finite differences:** Stencils shrink near boundaries; edge points excluded from evaluation
- **GP methods:** No special boundary treatment (kernel handles endpoints naturally)

**Consistency check:** Verified all methods produce predictions on same 99-point grid before computing errors

### 4.7.7 Statistical Validity with n=3 Trials

**Limitation:** With only 3 trials per configuration, statistical power for significance testing is limited

**95% Confidence Intervals:**
- Computed using t-distribution with df=2
- Wide intervals due to small sample size
- Reported for transparency but interpreted cautiously

**No formal hypothesis tests:** We avoid claiming "statistically significant" differences without adequate sample size (n ≥ 10 recommended)

**Qualitative interpretation guidelines:**
- Non-overlapping CIs → strong evidence of difference
- Overlapping CIs → insufficient evidence (not "no difference")
- Consistent ranking across all 3 trials → robust finding

**Mitigation strategy:** Future work should test on 10+ diverse signals per configuration to enable robust significance testing (see Section 10.2)
