## Major Accomplishments This Session

### 1. LaTeX Workflow Established
- ✅ Created complete LaTeX document structure (`paper.tex`)
- ✅ Modular sections in `sections/` directory
- ✅ Makefile for automated compilation (`make`, `make clean`, `make view`)
- ✅ README_LATEX.md with workflow documentation
- ✅ TODO markers compile cleanly (red text, highly visible)

### 2. Data-Driven Content Added
All TODOs requiring experimental data were filled with actual CSV results:

#### Table 2: Full-Coverage Methods Ranking (Section 6.1.1)
- 16 methods ranked by mean nRMSE across 56 configurations
- Data extracted from `comprehensive_summary.csv`
- GP-Julia-AD best (nRMSE = 0.257), AAA-HighPrec worst (nRMSE = 1.6×10²¹)

#### Table 3: Method Coverage Summary (Section 6.1.2)
- Documents 16/24 methods with full 56/56 coverage
- Shows partial-coverage methods (TVRegDiff, Central-FD: orders 0-1 only)
- Supports coverage bias claims with hard data

#### Table 4: Performance Degradation by Order (Section 6.2.2)
- 5 representative methods across derivative orders 0-7
- GP graceful degradation: 0.007 → 0.620
- AAA catastrophic growth: 0.011 → 1.3×10²²
- Regularization plateau: 0.014 → 0.995 at order 2

#### Table 5: Computational Cost vs Accuracy (Section 6.4)
- 8 methods with timing, nRMSE, speedup factors
- Fourier-Interp sweet spot: 23× faster, nRMSE = 0.44
- chebyshev fastest: 247× speedup
- AAA timing paradox: moderately fast, catastrophically inaccurate

#### Table 6: Noise Sensitivity at Order 4 (Section 6.5)
- Performance across 7 noise levels (10⁻⁸ to 5×10⁻²)
- GP graceful degradation: 0.038 → 0.683
- AAA catastrophic even at 10⁻⁸ noise: nRMSE = 57.9

#### Table 7: AAA Catastrophic Failure Detail (Section 7.2.1)
- Order-by-order breakdown at near-zero noise (10⁻⁸)
- Exponential growth from order 3: 0.097 → 57.9 → 2.13×10¹⁰
