## 7. Discussion
### 7.1 Why Gaussian Processes Dominate
- Theoretical: optimal under Gaussian assumptions with correct kernel
- Derivative estimation: closed-form via kernel differentiation
- Uncertainty quantification: built-in confidence intervals
- Regularization: automatic via kernel hyperparameters

### 7.2 The Rational Approximation Surprise
- AAA-HighPrec nearly matches GP at mid-range orders
- Advantage: deterministic, no stochastic optimization
- High-precision arithmetic crucial for numerical stability

### 7.3 Why Fourier Methods Required Tuning
- Noise amplification mechanism: (ik)^n operator
- Optimal filter fraction (0.4) more aggressive than expected
- Lesson: spectral methods need careful regularization

### 7.4 The Total Variation Limitation
- Iterative differentiation accumulates error
- First-order works well; second-order catastrophic
- Fundamental algorithmic issue, not implementation

### 7.5 When Finite Differences Fail
- Orders >3: noise amplification exceeds signal
- Numerical stability: catastrophic cancellation
- Conclusion: avoid FD for high-order noisy derivatives

### 7.6 Method Improvements During Study
- Fourier-Interp: 150× error reduction via filter tuning
- TVRegDiff: scope limitation to prevent catastrophic errors
- Demonstrates importance of rigorous benchmarking

### 8.4 Method Selection Flowchart
```
1. What is your noise level?
   - <1e-6: Use GP-Julia-AD or AAA-HighPrec (both excellent)

   - >1e-2: Use GP-Julia-AD (only reliable option for orders >2)

2. What derivative order do you need?
   - 0-1: Many methods work; GP-Julia-AD best, Smoothing-Spline acceptable
   - 2-3: GP-Julia-AD or AAA-HighPrec; avoid FD
   - 4-5: GP-Julia-AD strongly recommended
   - 6-7: GP-Julia-AD only; verify nRMSE acceptable for application

3. Do you need speed?
   - Yes + low noise: Try Fourier-Interp first
   - Yes + high noise: Use GP-Julia-AD (no fast alternative)

4. Do you need uncertainty quantification?
   - Yes: Use GP-Julia-AD (built-in confidence intervals)
