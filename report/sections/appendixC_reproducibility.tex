\section{Reproducibility}
\label{app:reproducibility}

This study was designed to be fully reproducible. All code, data, analysis scripts, and this manuscript's complete version history are available at the public Git repository: \url{https://github.com/orebas/deriv-estimation-study}.

The computational environment uses Julia 1.12.1 and Python 3.13.1, with all package dependencies managed by lock files to ensure exact package versions are preserved. All sources of randomness are deterministically seeded to ensure identical datasets are generated on each run.

The entire workflow, from running the comprehensive benchmark to generating all figures, tables, and this PDF, is fully automated. Complete documentation of the build pipeline, hardware specifications, and data availability can be found in the project Git repository.
