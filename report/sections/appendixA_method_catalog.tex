\section{Complete Method Catalog}
\label{sec:method_catalog_appendix}

This appendix provides the complete catalog of methods evaluated during our study. While the main analysis focuses on the 31 methods that demonstrated full coverage across derivative orders 0--5, we initially tested a broader set of implementations to ensure comprehensive coverage of available techniques. Tables~\ref{tab:python_methods_appendix} and \ref{tab:julia_methods_appendix} list all methods considered, including those that were excluded from the final analysis due to limited order support or stability issues.

\TODO{Insert detailed method tables here. This should include:
- Complete list of all tested methods (not just the 31 contenders)
- Implementation details and parameter ranges
- Reasons for exclusion where applicable
- Links to source code/packages where available}

% Note: The detailed method catalog from method_table.tex should be inserted here
% when the appendix is fully populated.
