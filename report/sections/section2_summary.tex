\TODO{Add comprehensive related work section discussing prior comparative studies of numerical differentiation methods, existing benchmarks, and foundational work in each method category (Gaussian processes, splines, spectral methods, filtering approaches). Include citations to seminal papers and recent advances in derivative estimation from noisy data.}

% Key areas to cover:
% - Prior comparative studies of numerical differentiation methods
% - Benchmarks in related fields (system identification, signal processing)
% - Foundational work on each method category:
%   - Gaussian process regression for derivatives
%   - Spline-based differentiation
%   - Spectral methods and Fourier approaches
%   - Savitzky-Golay and filtering methods
%   - Regularization approaches (Total Variation, Tikhonov)
% - Recent advances in automatic differentiation for numerical data
% - Applications driving the need for robust derivative estimation
