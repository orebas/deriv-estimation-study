# FINAL ANALYSIS - Curated Results

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Data Source**: `comprehensive_summary.csv` (1,309 rows)
**Excluded**: Poor implementations removed per user request

---

## METHODS EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSIS

### Broken Implementations (Removed)
1. **GP-Julia-SE**: Mean nRMSE = 38,238,701 - implementation failure
2. **TVRegDiff_Python**: Mean nRMSE = 14.186 (72× worse than Julia version)
3. **SavitzkyGolay_Python**: Mean nRMSE = 15,443 (17,500× worse than Julia version)

**Rationale**: When cross-language implementations exist and one is orders of magnitude worse, keep only the good one. These appear to be parameter mismatches or implementation bugs, not algorithmic differences.

### GP Methods - Both Kept
**GP-Julia-AD** and **GP_RBF_Python** both kept - they're both reasonable (within 4% of each other), represent different kernel/implementation choices.

---

## AAA METHODS - CRITICAL EVALUATION

### User Hypothesis
> "I expected AAA-HighPrec to do well with extremely small amounts of noise, and to degrade very very fast with noise (as it's an interpolator). But for near zero noise it should be useful. So I would expect a recommendation to use it in the noiseless case."

### Reality from Data

**Hypothesis is PARTIALLY CORRECT but CRITICALLY INCOMPLETE**

✅ **Correct**: AAA-HighPrec excels at very low noise for **low-order derivatives**
✅ **Correct**: It degrades rapidly with noise
❌ **WRONG**: It fails catastrophically at high orders **EVEN WITH NEAR-ZERO NOISE**

### AAA-HighPrec at Noise = 10⁻⁸ (Near-Zero)

| Order | nRMSE        | vs GP-Julia-AD | Verdict                    |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| 0     | 9.7×10⁻⁹     | **Wins 2929×** | ✅ EXCELLENT - use AAA     |
| 1     | 1.2×10⁻⁶     | **Wins 277×**  | ✅ EXCELLENT - use AAA     |
| 2     | 2.6×10⁻⁴     | **Wins 9×**    | ✅ GOOD - use AAA          |
| 3     | 0.097        | Loses 9×       | ❌ GP-AD better            |
| 4     | 57.9         | Loses 1533×    | ❌ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE    |
| 5     | 40,891       | Loses 477K×    | ❌ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE    |
| 6     | 29.7 million | Loses 206M×    | ❌ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE    |
| 7     | 21.3 billion | Loses 77B×     | ❌ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE    |

### Noise Thresholds (where nRMSE crosses 1.0)

| Order | Fails at Noise | Notes                               |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0     | NEVER          | Robust across all noise levels      |
| 1     | > 1×10⁻²       | Good up to 1% noise                 |
| 2     | > 1×10⁻⁴       | Marginal - only at very low noise   |
| 3+    | > 1×10⁻⁸       | **Unusable even at near-zero noise**|

### **REVISED AAA RECOMMENDATION**

**Use AAA-HighPrec ONLY for:**
- **Orders 0-2** at noise ≤ 10⁻⁸ (near-perfect data)
- Interpolation/smoothing tasks (order 0)
- NOT for derivatives order ≥ 3 at any noise level

**Typical use case**: "I have near-noiseless data and need to smooth it (order 0) or compute 1st/2nd derivatives only"

**Do NOT use for**: General-purpose derivative estimation, high-order derivatives, or noisy data

---

## DIERCKX-5 - HONORABLE MENTION

### Performance Summary
- **Coverage**: Orders 0-5 only (75% - missing orders 6-7)
- **Mean nRMSE**: 0.291 (good)
- **Median nRMSE**: 0.089 (excellent - 3rd best after Central-FD and GP-Julia-AD)
- **Speed**: 5ms (very fast - 156× faster than GP-Julia-AD)

### Per-Order Rankings (where tested)

| Order | nRMSE  | Rank | Notes                          |
|-------|--------|------|--------------------------------|
| 0     | 0.009  | #5   | Good                           |
| 1     | 0.031  | #5   | Good                           |
| 2     | 0.095  | #5   | Good                           |
| 3     | 0.203  | #5   | Good                           |
| 4     | 0.460  | #5   | Acceptable                     |
| 5     | 0.950  | #7   | Marginal (drops from top-5)    |
| 6     | N/A    | —    | **Not tested (degree limit)**  |
| 7     | N/A    | —    | **Not tested (degree limit)**  |

### **HONORABLE MENTION RATIONALE**

**Current implementation**: Capped at degree 5, cannot compute 6th/7th derivatives

**Hypothetical**: If implemented to support higher-order derivatives, Dierckx-5 would likely:
- Maintain competitive accuracy (consistently ranks #5 at orders 0-4)
- Provide excellent speed/accuracy tradeoff (5ms vs 780ms for GP-Julia-AD)
- Be a strong alternative to GP methods

**Recommendation**: "Dierckx-5 shows strong performance up to order 5 and excellent computational efficiency (5ms). The current implementation is limited by a degree-5 cap, preventing 6th/7th order derivative estimation. If the spline degree limitation were removed or extended, this method could be competitive across all derivative orders as a fast alternative to Gaussian Processes."

## MATERN KERNELS - STATUS

**Answer**: Matern kernels are **NOT in the current dataset**.

**Methods tested**:
- GP-Julia-AD: Yes (uses AD for derivatives)
- GP-Julia-SE: Yes (broken implementation)
- GP_RBF_Python: Yes (RBF kernel)
- GP_RBF_Iso_Python: Yes (isotropic RBF)
- gp_rbf_mean: Yes (RBF with mean function)

**No Matern variants found in the 27 methods tested.**

**User note**: "Last I check they took forever to run, not sure if we fixed that or not"
**Status**: Not included in comprehensive study - likely still have performance issues or were excluded due to runtime.

### Niche / Specialized

| Scenario                                  | Method          | Notes                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Near-noiseless** (≤10⁻⁸), orders 0-2   | AAA-HighPrec    | Beats GP-AD by 9-2929× at low orders     |
| **Orders 0-1 only** (no higher orders)   | Central-FD      | 0.034 mean, very fast (6ms)               |
| **Orders 0-5**, need speed                | **Dierckx-5**   | 0.089 median, 5ms - **if degree extended**|
| **Orders 0-1**, regularization needed    | TVRegDiff-Julia | 0.195 mean, handles discontinuities       |

### DO NOT USE

1. **GP-Julia-SE**: Broken implementation
2. **AAA methods for orders ≥3**: Catastrophic failures even at 10⁻⁸ noise
3. **AAA methods for noise >10⁻⁴**: Rapid degradation
4. **Python implementations** of TVRegDiff, SavitzkyGolay: 72-17,500× worse than Julia

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Coverage Bias is Critical
Only 16/27 methods tested across all configs. Rankings must account for incomplete coverage.

### 2. AAA is a Niche Tool
Excellent for smoothing (order 0) and 1st/2nd derivatives at near-zero noise. Catastrophically fails at higher orders even with perfect data.

### 3. Dierckx-5 Deserves Attention
If implementation extended beyond degree-5 limit, could be a strong fast alternative (5ms vs 780ms for GP).

### 4. GP Methods Dominate
All 4 GP variants (excluding broken GP-Julia-SE) rank in top 4 for full-coverage methods.

### 5. Implementation Quality Matters
Same algorithm (TVRegDiff, SavitzkyGolay) shows 72-17,500× performance difference between Julia and Python, likely due to parameters or bugs.

### 6. No Matern Kernels Tested
Not included in study - likely excluded due to performance issues.

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Why does AAA fail at high orders with near-zero noise?**
   - Likely derivative scaling (factorial terms), pole/zero proximity, or conditioning
   - Needs: Code audit, test on polynomials with known derivatives

2. **Can Dierckx-5 be extended to degree 7+?**
   - Current cap at degree 5 prevents 6th/7th order derivatives
   - If feasible, could provide fast alternative to GP methods

3. **Can Python implementations be fixed?**
   - TVRegDiff_Python, SavitzkyGolay_Python both orders of magnitude worse
   - Need parameter-parity testing with Julia versions

4. **Should Matern kernels be benchmarked?**
   - Not in current study (performance issues?)
   - Worth attempting if runtime can be optimized
