### Initial Summary & Key Questions

**1. Who wins for Lorenz vs. Lotka-Volterra?**
- The top performers are broadly consistent, with GP and spectral methods leading. However, the chaotic nature of the Lorenz system appears to challenge some methods more than the periodic oscillators.

**2. Do catastrophic failures (like AAA) persist across all systems?**
- Yes. The `AAA-HighPrec` and `AAA-LowPrec` methods show extremely high average nRMSE across all three systems, confirming their instability is not specific to one type of dynamic.

**3. Are there new failures on the chaotic system?**
- The list of worst performers is similar across systems, dominated by the AAA methods. This initial analysis doesn't show a method that was good on Lotka-Volterra but failed completely on Lorenz. A deeper dive would be needed to see how performance degrades for moderately-good methods.

**4. General Observations**
- Gaussian Process (`GP-*`) and Fourier-based (`Fourier-*`, `ad_trig_adaptive`) methods consistently rank at the top across all systems, demonstrating their robustness.
- The performance gap between the best and worst methods is vast, spanning many orders of magnitude.
